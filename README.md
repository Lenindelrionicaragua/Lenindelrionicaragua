Since my childhood, music has been my passion, as I have always been fascinated by its communicative power. This led me to initially study music and later pursue a degree in Social Communication at university. I have always believed that one of the most significant goals in life is the connection between the individual and the surrounding world, both for personal growth and for contributing to the future of society. This is why I enjoy web development so much; it has taken the interconnection of human beings to an unexpected level, and I am thrilled to be a part of this new stage of our civilization.

<p>Hooked Tetris is a single-page application aimed at creating an interactive and educational game by combining the classic Tetris with React hooks. The game features a main presentation screen where the player can create their avatar using the DiceBear HTTP API. Upon completing the avatar creation, the player is redirected to the game screen to play Tetris. Eliminating lines in the Tetris game reveals tips and information about various React hooks.</p>
